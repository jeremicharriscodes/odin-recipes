        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cebiche, also known as ceviche or seviche, usually consists of seafood that is marinated with lime juice, the acidity of the lime juice actually “cooks” the seafood.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds of fresh, high quality fish fillets</li>
            <li>1 red onion</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
            <li>1-2 habanero peppers</li>
            <li>2-3 sprigs of fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>Finely chopped cilantro to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the fish into small cubes, place in a glass bowl and cover with cold water and 1 tablespoon of salt, cover and refrigerate while you prepare the onions and juice the limes.</li>
            <li>Rub the thin onion slices with 1/2 tablespoon of salt and rinse in cold water.</li>
            <li>Rinse the fish to remove the salt</li>
            <li>Place the cubes of fish, half of the sliced onions, and hot peppers in a glass bowl and pour the lime juice over the ingredients. Sprinkle with a little bit of salt. To minimize the acidity of the limes you can put a few ice cubes in the mix.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate for about 5-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the cilantro sprigs and the hot peppers from the mix. Taste the fish ceviche and add additional salt if needed.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon to place the ceviche in each serving bowl, add additional sliced onions to each bowl, sprinkle with finely chopped cilantro, and diced or sliced hot peppers.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with your choice of sides and garnishes.</li>
        </ol>
