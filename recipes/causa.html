        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Peruvian Causa or Causa limeña (from Lima) is a Peruvian dish made of layers of mashed potato and filled with chicken, tuna or other more modern alternatives.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250 g Peruvian yellow chilli</li>
            <li>500 g Peruvian yellow potato</li>
            <li>2 tbsp canolo oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>
            <li>250 g chicken breast</li>
            <li>6 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 avocados</li>
            <li>Hard-boiled quail eggs</li>
            <li>Baby rocket leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut off the head of the chillies and cut them in half lengthwise.
            </li>
            <li>Using a small knife, remove the seeds and veins.
            </li>
            <li>Place a pot with cold water and boil for 10-15min or until you can easily peel the skin off. You should be able to rub the skin at a corner and it should easily peel by pulling.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the chillies from the water, peel and blend. If your blender needs a bit of liquid, add a drizzle of vegetable oil, just the minimum amount to help your blender.
            </li>
            <li>Reserve what you need for the recipe and you can freeze the rest for up to 6 months.
            </li>
            <li>If you're using Peruvian yellow potatoes (ideal) or Yukon Gold then peel them and remove the eyes. Cook in salted cold water over medium heat. Don't let it go on to a rolling boil or the outside will disintegrate before the centre cooks. We take them out once you can easily pierce them with a knife. Don't let them overcook or they will start to disintegrate.
            </li>
            <li>If you're using another type of potato such as Russet, cook it in the oven with the skin on at 200°C/400°F for 1 hour – 1.5 hours or until really tender. We do it this way so the final product is as dry as the yellow potato.
            </li>
            <li>Pass the potato through a potato ricer while it's still hot (it gets tough when it's cold!).
            </li>
            <li>Add all the other ingredients and mix until homogeneous. Taste and adjust the salt level if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>Place the chicken in a pot with cold, salted water. Let it come to a boil over medium-low heat. Don't let it come to a rolling boil or the meat could become tough. Cook it for 15-20min from the moment it starts to boil. It shouldn't be pink if you cut into it. Remove it from the water and shred it.
            </li>
            <li>Mix the chicken with the mayonnaise, salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Line a 21x13cm/8x4in pan with cling film or baking paper. You can also use individual rings.
            </li>
            <li>Flatten half of the potato mix on the base.
            </li>
            <li>On top, layer the avocados and season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Then, make a layer with the chicken and flatten it.
            </li>
            <li>Finish with another layer of potato. Cover in cling film and refrigerate for at least 2 hours if you're going to unmould it onto a plate.
            </li>
            <li>Garnish on top however you like. I used quail eggs and baby rocket leaves.
            </li>
        </ol>
